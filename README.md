- Hi, Iâ€™m Hikaru Yamamoto
  <br>Born and raised in Christchurch, New Zealand.
  <br>I am currently based in Tokyo,Japan. 
  <br>I am currently using GitHub as a learning platform.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in front-end development.
  <br>Being part of CMS migration project with my previous job, I gainied a holisitic overview of front-end and back-end development.
  <br>This inspired me to get more hands on the front-end side so that I can customise web pages on an ad-hoc basis.
  <br>I have a particular interest in e-commerce sites as we migrated from Shopify to <a href="https://github.com/EC-CUBE">EC-CUBE</a>
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML and CSS. Eventually I would like to move onto Javascript
